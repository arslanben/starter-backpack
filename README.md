The aim of the easy, clear and fast command list is to save you time by quickly selecting the commands you want to access through the options. 🚀

Most commands are not memorable, especially for Linux beginners! 🤯

This tool will be your backpack, it will evolve (no promises) and as it evolves it will become more and more useful. 🎒📈

I would like to thank my friends [@chatgpt](https://chat.openai.com/) & [@claudeai](https://claude.ai/) who helped me in this project for their help and the convenience they provided and the time they saved. 🙏🤖
